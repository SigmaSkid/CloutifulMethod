# Osu! Cloutiful Method - AHK Script
## Overview
This AutoHotkey (AHK) script is a simple implementation of the cheating method employed by the player Cloutiful before his ban in osu!. Unlike the original method, this script does not require Wooting software. It includes a randomized delay for keypresses, making detection methods previously used to identify Cloutiful's cheating ineffective.

## Features
- Randomized Delay: Adds a random noise to the delay, mimicking human-like keypress intervals.
- Simple Implementation: Easy-to-understand and modify script.
- Customizable Keys: Default keys are 'S' and 'D', but can be changed as needed.

## Usage
- Install AutoHotkey v2.0+
- Copy the Script
- Run the Script

By default the script uses S and D keys, so you will have to either modify the script 
or change your input keys in game.

## Python Script for Bell Curve Distribution
In addition to the AutoHotkey script, there's a Python script provided (plot_delay_distribution.py) that showcases the normal distribution of the randomized delay.  
This script provides a visual representation of how the delay times are distributed around the mean value, demonstrating the randomness introduced by the bell curve method.

## Important Notice
This script is intended for educational purposes only. Using scripts or any third-party tools to gain an advantage in competitive games may violate the game's terms of service. Always ensure fair play and abide by the rules of the game.

# Additional Information
## Background on the Cheating Method
A player known as Cloutiful utilized this method to gain an unfair advantage in the game osu!. The method exploited the key behavior to simulate high accuracy with a double-tap motion, which typically requires significant skill to achieve with alternating taps.
